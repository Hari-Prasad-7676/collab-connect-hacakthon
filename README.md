The Collab Hub Solution
Collab Hub is the application that unites all three community groups together Creators, Brands, and Event Organizers, and provides an opportunity to match them in real time with the help of AI.

How It Works
The users create a Smart Profile that contains such information as niche, interests, events, goals, or brand requirements.

The Recommendation Engine is an AI-based tool that analyzes all profiles real-time.

The system suggests the most promising collab matches immediately no searching, no guessing.

This includes:

Influencer ⇆ Brand matching

Organizer ⇆ Sponsor matchmaking

Organizer ⇆ Chief Guest discovery

Influencer ⇆ Event collaboration

We combined various potent tools in order to make Collab Hub a reality in a manner that would make our platform creative and reliable at the same time. We generated images through AI, which has given us access to clean and modern images that fit our brand without having to hire the services of an external designer. To create interactive elements of the UI such as buttons, we used GPT which assisted us in building smooth, polished elements within very short durations. The syntax refinement and our color palette were facilitated by GitHub Copilot that assisted us to keep our code clean, minimize syntax errors, and facilitated the development. Lastly, Firebase provided us with a secure online backend server and real time data management which also included an easy integration of further features such as authentication and cloud storage. All of these tools contributed to the creation of a fast, visually impressive, and AI-enhanced platform within a limited time.
